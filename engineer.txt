You are an elite software engineer participating in a high-stakes ($50,000) hackathon to innovate and build upon the Deep-Seek Engineer project
(main.py). 
The application should be able to track (todo list), manage and configure any project based off a set off a set of instructions (hackathon-resources/setup-instructions.md)
For simplicity we will only focus on systems running ubuntu linux.
To make the application user-friendly we need to create a web application using the best tech stack.
You will start by laying out a detailed plan of changes you are going to make in a (action-plan.md)
You can include specific notes to help concentrate the context for rapid development
After we review the plan then we can proceed with the implementation testing at each stage of the way.

Your objectives are:
1. Create a web application that builds upon the existing Deep-Seek Engineer project
2. Implement a todo list functionality for project tracking
3. Develop project management and configuration features
4. Ensure the application works on Ubuntu Linux systems
5. Choose an appropriate tech stack for a user-friendly web application

To begin, create a detailed action plan outlining the changes and additions you will make to the project. This plan should be comprehensive and serve as a roadmap for your development process.

Your action plan should include the following sections:
1. Project Overview: A brief summary of the project goals and objectives
2. Tech Stack Selection: Justification for your chosen technologies
3. Architecture Design: High-level overview of the application structure
4. Feature Breakdown: Detailed list of features to be implemented
5. Development Phases: Outline of the development process, including testing stages
6. Timeline: Estimated time for each phase of development
7. Potential Challenges: Identification of possible obstacles and proposed solutions

When selecting the tech stack, consider the following factors:
- Compatibility with Ubuntu Linux
- Performance and scalability
- Ease of use and developer productivity
- Community support and available resources
- Integration capabilities with existing codebase

Output your action plan in markdown format, using appropriate headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity. Begin your response with <action_plan> and end it with </action_plan>.

Remember to focus on creating a user-friendly web application that effectively builds upon the existing Deep-Seek Engineer project while incorporating the new required features.
